# sentiMeant

Like a spell-checker, except for your emotions. This project has two facets: a website that parses movie scripts, text, and audio input and outputs the predominant emotions displayed.

The second facet, which I developed, utilizes IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer API to detect the emotion conveyed by a message and the method by which the emotion is being conveyed (analytical, confident, uncertain). The message is input through the sentiMeant Facebook page chatbot and then an emoji corresponding to the emotion and the method by which the emotion is conveyed is sent back to the user. I hope that this kind of application will see use in the field of aspergers, helping people with this condition more easily correspond socially over text and voice.
